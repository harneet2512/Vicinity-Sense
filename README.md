# Vicinity Sense
## Overview
This project focuses on optic disc segmentation using a YOLOv3-based object detection approach. The code is designed for detecting and classifying objects, with a primary focus on identifying the optic disc in medical images.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
YOLO-Framework

## Usage
Download YOLOv3 Weights, Configuration, and COCO Class Names:

Obtain the YOLOv3 weights file (yolov3.weights).
Acquire the YOLOv3 configuration file (yolov3.cfg).
Download the COCO class names file (coco.names).
Set Paths in the Code:

Set the paths for YOLOv3 weights (weightsPath), configuration file (configPath), and COCO class names (coco_names) in the script.
Define Video Path:

Define the path to the video file (video_path variable).
Run the Script:



Execute the script to initiate the optic disc segmentation.
